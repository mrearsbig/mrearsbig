## 🚀 About

I’m a systems engineer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect digital experiences where robust engineering meets intuitive design. Over the past three years, I’ve transformed complex problems into elegant solutions—bridging technical precision with visual creativity to elevate user experiences.

Specializing in full-stack development for enterprise systems and mobile applications, I leverage modern technologies and architectures to build interfaces that balance functionality with human-centric design. My focus is on clean, maintainable code that stands the test of time.

Beyond coding, I channel my design passion into personal projects like crafting my personal brand identity and exploring UI/UX principles. I actively contribute to tech communities, believing collaborative learning drives innovation.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me playing as a creative midfielder in weekend soccer matches, gaming (currently on Call of Duty: Warzone and EA Sports FC 25), or traveling to absorb new cultures while hunting the world’s best empanadas.

I thrive in teams where curiosity fuels progress. Let’s build solutions that don’t just function—but inspire.
